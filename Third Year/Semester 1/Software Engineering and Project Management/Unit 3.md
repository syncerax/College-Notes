## Unit 3: Project Planning

### Project Planning

Project planning is an important activity conducted by project managers to in order to estimate the following entities for their optimum use.

- The resources required for the project
- The cost of the project
- The schedule for completion of the project in time

### Project Initiation

The Project Initiation Phase is the first phase in the Project Management Life Cycle. It involves starting up a new project. We start a new project by defining its objectives, scope, purpose and deliverables to be produced. The Project Initiation steps are listed below:

- Develop a Business Case
  - A Business Case justifies the start-up of a project. It includes a description of the business problem, opportunity, the costs and benefits of each solution, and the recommended solution.

- Undertake a Feasibility Study
  - A Project Feasibility Study involves documenting each of the potential solutions to the particular business problem in order to identify the likelihood of the solutions meeting the stated requirements.

- Establish the Project Charter
  - A Project Charter outlines the purpose of the project, the way the project will be structured, and how it will be implemented. It defines the boundaries, as well as the roadmap for the project.

- Appoint the Project Team
  - The Project Team details all the team members with their roles and job descriptions.

- Set up the Project Office
  - The Project Office refers to the support staff not directly involved in the delivery of the project.

- Perform a Phase Review
  - A Project Review is an assessment of the status of a project at a particular point in time. Different reviews are conducted during different phases of the project, and these are called Phase Reviews. The first Phase Review is conducted at the end of the Initiation phase.

### Planning Scope Management

Scope management refers to the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. Scope management relates to defining and controlling the work that is included in a project. The different tasks of a scope management plan are:

- To write a detailed scope statement.
- To create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- To maintain a WBS.
- To obtain acceptance about deliverables.
- To handle requests about change of project scope.



### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

A deliverable-oriented grouping of project elements that organises and defines the total scope of the project by breaking it down into smaller components is called the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

Eg: WBS for ~~cooking breakfast (milk and sandwiches)~~ must be something technical.

### Importance of Project Scheduling.

- To organise and complete your projects in a timely, quality and financially responsible manner.
- Project scheduling impacts the overall finances of a project. Time constraints require project managers to schedule resources effectively. This is particularly true when the resources must have highly specialised skills.
- With accurate project scheduling, realistic estimates and accurate projections prevent last minute orders that drive up costs.
- A project schedule allows you to assign human resources to the work and evaluate their allocation to ensure that you have the appropriate levels of utilisation.
- Project scheduling ensures that one task gets completed in a quality manner before the next task in the process begins.

### Estimating Activity Resources and Duration

- Estimating Activity Resources is the process of estimating the type and quantities of material, human resources, equipment, or supplies needed to perform each activity.
- The key benefit of this process is that it identifies the type and quantity of resources required, which allows more accurate cost and duration estimates.



- Estimating Activity Duration is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual activities with estimated resources.
- The ket benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity will take to be completed, which is a major input for the project scheduling process.

### Earned Value Analysis

- During project tracking, each developer gives his project or task progress status to the manager. But this assessment is subjective.
- There should be some quantitative technique for assessing the progress of a project.
- Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is a technique used for quantitative analysis, It is carried out in the following way:
- The time to complete the total project is estimated and every task is given an earned value based on its estimated percentage of the total.
- To determine the earned value, the following steps are performed:
  - The Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) is calculated for each task.
  - The BCWS values are all added up to calculate the final budget.
    Budget At Completion:   $BAC = ∑BCWS_k$	(for all k tasks)
    - The value for Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) is calculated.
    - Progress indicators can be calculated as:

    - Scheduled Performance Index: $SPI = \dfrac{BCWP}{BCWS}$
    - Scheduled Variance:  $SV = BCWP - BCWS$
  - An SPI close to 1.0 indicates efficient execution of project schedule.
  - Also, the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) is the sum of efforts that have actually been expanded on completed work tasks.
    - Cost Performance Index: $CPI = \dfrac{BCWP}{ACWP}$
    - Cost Variance: $CV = BCWP - ACWP$
  - A CPI close to 1.0 indicates that the project is spending close to its budget.

### Critical Path Method (CPM)

- The CPM is a project scheduling technique, developed in the late 1950s, that can be applied to any project with interdependent activities.
- The essential technique for using CPM is to construct a model of the project that includes the following:
	1. A list of all activities required to complete the project.
	2. The time that each activity will take to complete.
	3. The dependencies between the activities.
	4. Logical end points, such as milestones.

- A critical path is the sequence of project network activities which add up to the longest overall duration. This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project.
- CPM analysis tools allow a user to select a logical end point in a project and quickly identify its longest series of dependent activities (its longest path). These tools can display the critical path as a cascading waterfall from the project’s start to the logical end point.

### Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

- PERT is a statistical tool used in project management. It was designed to analyse the tasks involved in completing a given project.
- It is commonly used in conjunction with CPM.
- PERT is a method of analysing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and the minimum time needed to complete the project.
- PERT planning involves the following steps:

	1. Identify the specific activities and milestones.
	2. Determine the proper sequence of the activities.
	3. Construct a network diagram.
	4. Estimate the time required for each activity (Optimistic time, Most likely time and Pessimistic time).
	5. Determine the critical path.
	6. Update the PERT chart as the project progresses.
