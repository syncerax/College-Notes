## Unit 4: Agile Development Process

### Extreme Programming Process

The XP process encompasses four framework activities:

1. Planning
2. Design
3. Coding
4. Testing

Planning starts with the requirement gathering activity that enables the XP team to understand the business rules for the software. Customers and developers work together to finalise the requirements.

XP design rigorously follows the KIS (Keep It Simple) principle. A simpler design is preferred over a more complex one.

After the preliminary design process, the team develops a series of unit tests. After this, the coding process is conducted. Once the code is complete, it can be tested with the unit tests. A key concept used during the coding activity in XP is pair programming. XP recommends that two people work together at one computer to write code.

All the individual unit tests are organised into a “universal testing suite”. Integration and validation testing of the system can occur on a daily basis. XP acceptance tests, also called customer tests are specified by the customer and focus on overall system features and functionality.

### Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of changing software in a way that it does not affect its external behaviour but improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimises the chances of introducing bugs. In essence, refactoring is the process of improving the design of code after it has been written.

### Scrum

Scrum is an agile software development method. It is an iterative and incremental software development process. Scrum principles are consistent with the agile manifesto.



In the scrum process, within each framework activity, work tasks occur within a process pattern called a sprint.



Sprints consist of work units (that are required to achieve a requirement) that must be fit into a predefined time period (usually 14 days).



Product backlog is a list of prioritised product features provided by the customer. The customer can add items to the list at any time (this is how changes are introduced). Sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog. It is a set of features assigned to a particular sprint.



Changes (i.e. new backlog items) are not introduced during a sprint. Hence, the sprint allows developers to work in a short-term, but stable environment.



Scrum meetings are short (usually 15 minutes) meetings held daily by the team. During the scrum meeting, each team member answers three key questions:

- What did you do since the last meeting?
- What obstacles are you encountering?
- What will you do before the next meeting?

A team leader, called the scrum master, leads the meeting and assesses the responses of each person. Scrum meetings help in finding potential problems as early as possible.
