# Software Design and Modelling

# Unit 4: Object Oriented Design

### Component Diagram

- The component diagram models the physical implementation of the software specified by the logical requirements in class diagram.
- Classes describe the logical organization and intent of your software design. Components describe the physical implementations of your software design.
- The purpose of the component diagram is to define physical software modules and their relationships to one another. Doing so provides a means of defining software as a set of modular units that may be assembled to create successively larger modular units. Components may represent anything from a single class to applications, subsystems, and systems.
- There are three types of components:
  - **Deployment components**, which are required to run the system. Eg: operating systems, Java Virtual Machines (JVM), and Database Management Systems (DBMS).
  - **Work product components**, including models, source code, and data files used to create deployment components. Eg: UML diagrams, Java class and JAR files, and database tables.
  - **Execution components**, which are components created while running the application. Eg: servlets, HTML and XML documents.
